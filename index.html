Between the year 1997 to the present, officials have been collecting a census of the average daily population both in-house and out-house that NY County jails are responsible for. With that, there was an almost steady rise in how many prisoners were incaracerated for federal offense after 1999. In fact, after the census hit an all time low across all the years it was collected (1999), a decade after (2011), the census hit an all time high. This data is based on the census collected from all NYC and non-NYC facilities and proves that after the new milenium, crime rates shot up.Although there was a slight dip in this rate from 2011 to 2014, it is clear that federal crime rates are still on the rise as demonstrated by the rise in the daily census population within facilities up until the most recently recorded year (2021).
